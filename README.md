## Fork features

This repository tracks upstream Xray-core and maintains additional server-focused features and hardening:

- **In-tree sing-mux stack:** sing-mux-compatible `smux` and `h2mux` clients and servers with TCP/UDP streams, optional padding, bounded connection pools, and no runtime dependency on an external mux library. H2MUX is selected outbound with `smux.protocol` and auto-detected inbound. See the [wire protocol specification](common/singmux/SPEC.md).
- **Per-inbound H2MUX frame size:** `smux.h2muxMaxReadFrameSize` advertises `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` to H2MUX clients, whose per-stream upload buffers scale with it. Omitting it keeps the 1 MiB library default.
- **Brutal congestion control:** opt-in Brutal bandwidth negotiation for outbound SMUX/H2MUX clients and per-inbound servers through `smux.brutal-opts` (`enabled`, `up`, and `down`). Linux servers need the `brutal` congestion-control module.
- **Structured logging:** multiple independent console, JSONL file, and Unix-socket outputs with event filtering, batching, bounded queues, and configurable backpressure. Legacy logging remains supported. See the [configuration guide](common/log/CONFIGURATION.md).
- **Exact online presence:** when `statsUserOnline` is enabled, `user>>><email>>>online`, `GetStatsOnlineIpList`, and `GetAllOnlineUsers` follow authenticated logical traffic rather than long-lived carriers. This covers direct traffic, SMUX/H2MUX, legacy Mux/XUDP, reverse connections, and WireGuard flows.
- **REALITY without the X25519MLKEM768 gate:** the fork builds against a REALITY module that is upstream REALITY `main` with commit `8cdf7bf` reverted, wired in through a `replace` of `github.com/xtls/reality` in `go.mod`. The server prefers an X25519 key share, falls back to the X25519 half of X25519MLKEM768, and accepts Client Hellos without X25519MLKEM768.
- **Operator-controlled REALITY client versions:** server-side `minClientVer` and `maxClientVer` are optional and have no built-in default. An omitted bound rejects no client on that side of the range.
- **Expanded protocol sniffing:** QUIC v2 Initial packets and BitTorrent UDP traffic (uTP, DHT, and UDP trackers) can be identified for routing or blocking. QUIC sniffing reassembles a ClientHello split across datagrams, including datagrams padded after the Initial packet (Firefox) and flows mixing several connections, and leaves the sniffed datagrams unmodified.
- **Hysteria/Realm extensions:** Realm supports `ipMode` selection and optional UPnP/NAT-PMP port mapping; finalmask QUIC settings expose loss-compensation, Chrome-parrot, and GSO controls synchronized with Hysteria 2.13.0 behavior, including Chrome 154 parroting. Port hopping is configured only with the `udphop` UDP mask in `finalmask.udp`.
- **XDNS hardening:** the xdns finalmask bounds per-client server state, keeps serving after transient read errors, closes resolvers without hanging, frames TCP resolver queries correctly, and answers only names under its domain. It must be the last entry of `finalmask.udp`; other placements are rejected when the configuration is built.
- **ECH key generation:** `xray tls ech` rejects public names that ECH clients ignore (IP literals, ports, non-DNS labels), picks a random `--configId` by default, and accepts a `--maxNameLength` padding hint, matching `hysteria ech`.
- **uTLS fingerprint fidelity:** session resumption falls back to a full handshake when adding ticket or PSK extensions would change the selected fingerprint's original ClientHello shape.
- **Server-path hardening:** the fork carries additional VLESS/REALITY/Vision, mux lifecycle, buffering, half-close, and UDP correctness fixes. Exact changes and validation results are documented in the [fork releases](https://github.com/Jolymmiles/Xray-core/releases).

Official fork release artifacts currently target Linux. Other platforms can be built from source. New configuration surfaces are opt-in, and existing upstream configurations remain supported.
